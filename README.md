üí¨ Content Description 
This project is a Temperature Converter Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface where users can enter a temperature value, choose the original unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin), and convert it to the desired temperature unit with a single click. This kind of project is great for beginners in web development, as it reinforces concepts like form input handling, DOM manipulation, conditionals, and basic UI design.

üîß Features
The application includes the following core elements:

Input Field:
Users can enter the temperature value they wish to convert. The input is validated to ensure it is a number to avoid incorrect calculations or errors.

Unit Selection:
A dropdown menu or a group of radio buttons allows users to choose the original unit of the temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin). Another dropdown is available for the target unit to which they want to convert the input temperature.

Convert Button:
Once the temperature and units are selected, clicking the Convert button triggers the JavaScript function that performs the appropriate calculation and displays the result.

Result Display:
After conversion, the result is clearly displayed on the page along with the correct temperature unit, so the user immediately sees the output without confusion.

üå°Ô∏è Temperature Conversion Logic
The core of the application is built around conditional logic that checks the selected units and applies the appropriate formulas, such as:

Celsius to Fahrenheit: (C √ó 9/5) + 32

Fahrenheit to Celsius: (F ‚àí 32) √ó 5/9

Celsius to Kelvin: C + 273.15

Kelvin to Celsius: K - 273.15

Fahrenheit to Kelvin: ((F ‚àí 32) √ó 5/9) + 273.15

Kelvin to Fahrenheit: ((K ‚àí 273.15) √ó 9/5) + 32

This ensures accurate conversion between all combinations of Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

üé® UI & Styling
The interface is styled using CSS for a clean, modern look. CSS Flexbox or Grid is used to align the form elements neatly. Additional design touches like hover effects on buttons and a visually distinct output area enhance the user experience.

üöÄ Extra Challenge
For an added level of complexity, this converter also includes support for Kelvin conversions, making it more versatile and educational.

This project is ideal for those learning JavaScript and looking for a hands-on way to apply logic, form validation, and UI interaction on a real-world example.
